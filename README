Geologic Digitizer
18 June 2019

This is a geologic digitizer created by computer science students Marcelo
Gonzales, Jessy Liao, Alexis Ludeman, and Courtney Richardson from the
Colorado School of Mines for the geology department at their school.

================================== BACKGROUND ==================================
"Graphic logs are the most common way of characterizing sedimentary geologic
rock formations in outcrop and core data.  The term graphic log originates
from a geologist measuring and drawing graphically, or ‘logging’, a cored or
outcropping stratigraphic section.  Graphic logs generally have thickness/depth
on the y axis, and grain size on the x axis.  Many geologists spend weeks in
the field carefully measuring and logging rock formations at fine-scale in an
analog, hand-drawn manner. The fine-scale thickness and grain-size data that
may have taken days or weeks to collect is often never captured digitally in a
tabular format that can be analyzed. So, while tens of thousands of meters of
graphic logs measured at fine-scale exist to quantify various geological parameters,
the data contained in the graphic logs is rarely digitized and available for use.

While software solutions exist to collect graphic log data in the field there
are thousands of hand-drawn logs that need to be digitized.  This project aims to
create an executable where a geologist can digitize the rock layers from a hand-
drawn graphic log.

We hope that the open-source release of this executable will spur the collection of
quantified, structured, and comparable data that, with continued advances in the
accessibility of machine-learning to geologists, will lead to new discoveries
in sedimentary geology." - Zane Jobe

=================================== OVERVIEW ===================================
This program allows the user to choose an image from their computer, edit the
image, and then get it traced and pruned so that the outline of the graph is
saved in a CSV file through its x and y coordinates.  The user will have the
option to reload images, and erase or draw lines so that the CSV matches as
closely as possible to the real core sample of rock.  This program can be used to
digitize legacy data, or keep new data up to date.  This is intended to be open-
sourced as there were many features that could not be implemented in the time
provided for the original project.  The goal is for this program to adapt and
evolve into an extremely useful piece of equipment for geologist around the world.
